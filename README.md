# Rob's Half Life 2 Map Ratings
*An attempt to rate and categorise over 1800 half life 2 deathmatch maps*

This repo contains our ratings for the map collection mostly scraped from [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/mods/cats/5328), and the code for a static site for presenting the information.

View the site here: [https://hl2.arbitrarydata.co.uk/](https://hl2.arbitrarydata.co.uk/)

A note on the ratings: Most of these ratings are given playing these maps with only 2 players. So there are some decent maps here that have low ratings just because they don't work very well with 2 players.
